## Project Write-Up: Medicare E-Healthcare Web Application

### Project Overview

**Project Title:** Medicare  
**Course:** Course-end Project 1  
**Objective:** To create a dynamic and responsive Java e-healthcare web application for ordering medicines across different categories.

### Background

Medicare, established in 2012 in Delhi, India, has been a trusted supplier of medicines and healthcare essentials. Despite a strong market presence, the company has faced declining sales since 2017. An analysis revealed that competitors like 100mg and mfine are outpacing Medicare by offering direct online ordering, thereby eliminating intermediaries. To address this challenge, Medicare's management decided to develop a robust e-healthcare web application to streamline the ordering process and enhance user experience. As a Full Stack Java developer, I was tasked with creating a solution that meets these needs.

### Project Requirements

The web application will feature:

- **User Registration and Login:** Allow users to create accounts and securely log in to their profiles.
- **Payment Gateway Integration:** Facilitate smooth transactions using secure payment gateways.
- **Search Functionality:** Enable users to search for medicines by name or category.
- **Filtering and Sorting:** Provide options to filter and sort products based on various criteria, including price, category, and seller.
- **Dynamic Data Management:** Ensure data is fetched and displayed dynamically without hardcoded values.
- **Responsiveness:** Ensure the application is compatible with various devices, providing a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

### Recommended Technologies

- **Database Management:** MySQL and Oracle for robust data storage and management.
- **Backend Development:** Java and NodeJS for server-side logic and API development.
- **Frontend Development:** JSP, Angular, Bootstrap, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript for a rich and interactive user interface.
- **Automation and Testing:** Use Selenium for end-to-end testing, Jasmine for frontend testing, and TestNG for backend testing.
- **DevOps Technologies:** Git and GitHub for version control, Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment, Docker and Kubernetes for containerization, and AWS for hosting and deployment.

### Project Development Guidelines

The project will be structured into four sprints, each delivering a minimal viable product (MVP). Key guidelines include:

1. **Sprint Planning:** Conduct thorough sprint planning using user stories to define project components.
2. **Dynamic Data Handling:** Ensure all data interactions (fetching and sending) are dynamic, without reliance on hardcoded values.
3. **Version Control:** Maintain the project's version history on GitHub, committing changes regularly.
4. **CI/CD Pipeline Implementation:** Utilize Jenkins to create a CI/CD pipeline that automates testing and deployment processes.
5. **AWS Deployment:** Host the application on an AWS EC2 instance for robust accessibility.
6. **Automation Testing:** Implement automated tests before the application progresses to the CI/CD pipeline to ensure quality.
7. **Git Branching Strategy:** Use Git branching for separate automation testing processes.
8. **User-Friendly Interface:** Design a frontend that is intuitive and easy to navigate, enhancing the overall user experience.

### Portal Features

#### Admin Portal

The admin portal will provide backend functionalities, enabling admins to:

- **Manage Medicine Inventory:** Add, edit, or remove medicine details, ensuring the product line is up-to-date.
- **Enable/Disable Products:** Control product visibility based on availability or promotional strategies.
- **Update Product Information:** Regularly update pricing, descriptions, and offers to reflect current market conditions.

#### User Portal

The user portal will focus on user engagement, allowing end-users to:

- **Sign In:** Maintain a personalized experience with activity records.
- **Search Products:** Utilize a keyword-based search to quickly find medicines.
- **Filter and Sort Results:** Apply filters and sorting options to identify the best deals.
- **Cart Functionality:** Add selected items to the cart, allowing users to customize their purchases before checkout.
- **Payment Processing:** Complete transactions through a seamless payment gateway.
- **Order Summary Page:** Provide a detailed order summary upon successful payment completion.

### Conclusion

The Medicare e-healthcare web application aims to modernize the online medicine ordering process, enhancing user experience and improving sales. By employing a robust technology stack and adhering to agile methodologies, this project is positioned to deliver a comprehensive solution that meets both administrative and user needs effectively. Through careful planning, dynamic development, and thorough testing, Medicare can regain its competitive edge in the evolving healthcare market.
